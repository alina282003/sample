# Interview

There are 2 exercises in this project.

**Gym**

Test in `GymTest` is failing - fix it and make any refactors you want.

I refactor and fix the code for the test

**News**

Class `GetAllNewsUseCase` is not finished - implement it, refactor anything you'd like and ensure tests in `GetAllNewsUseCaseTest` pass.

I implemented the code and made the test pass.
